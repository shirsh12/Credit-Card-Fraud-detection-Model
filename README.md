# Project Description

It is vital that credit card companies are able to identify fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. The dataset used contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. The dataset has been collected and analyzed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universite Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.
